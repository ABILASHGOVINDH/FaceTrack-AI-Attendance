# FaceTrack-AI-Attendance
This project is a web-based attendance system that utilizes AI-powered face recognition to automate the attendance-taking process. Built with Django, it integrates OpenCV for real-time face detection and recognition, allowing users to record their attendance by simply standing in front of a webcam.
