FaceTrack-AI-Attendance is a Django-based web application that integrates facial recognition technology for efficient attendance management. By utilizing OpenCVâ€™s Haar Cascade classifier for real-time face detection via webcam, the application captures, processes, and saves facial images to a timestamped directory for daily attendance records. The system offers a user-friendly interface where users can log in, take attendance, and manage their profiles, with attendance data securely stored in an SQLite database. This project bridges AI-powered facial recognition with Django's robust web framework to streamline attendance tracking, making it a practical solution for organizations seeking automated attendance systems.
